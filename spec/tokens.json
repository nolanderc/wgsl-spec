Note: This attribute influences how a value of the enclosing structure type can appear in memory: at which byte addresses the structure itself and its component members can appear. In particular, the rules in § 13.4 Memory Layout combine to imply the following constraint: If align( n ) is applied to a member of S with type T, and S is the store type or contained in the store type for a variable in address space C, then n must satisfy: n = k × RequiredAlignOf ( T, C ) for some positive integer k.",

There is no effect on a position built-in input value. Must only be applied to the position built-in value.

Must only be applied to the declaration of a function with a return type. Note: Many functions return a value and do not have side effects. It is often a programming defect to call such a function as the only thing in a function call statement. Built-in functions with these properties are declared as @must_use. User-defined functions can also have the @must_use attribute. Note: To deliberately work around the @must_use rule, use a phony assignment or declare a value using the function call as the initializer.",

A shader-creation error results if any specified parameter is a const-expression that evaluates to a non-positive value. A pipeline-creation error results if any specified parameter evaluates to a non-positive value or exceeds an upper bound specified by the WebGPU API, or if the product of the parameter values exceeds the upper bound specified by the WebGPU API (see WebGPU § 3.6.2 Limits )."
